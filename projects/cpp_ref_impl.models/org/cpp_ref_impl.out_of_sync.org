This model is designed to be out of sync with the generated code. It
tests the behaviour of Dogen when faced with the following scenarios:

- model elements that have not changed.
- model elements that have changed.
- files that are expected to be ignored.
- files that are unexpected.

If you need to regenerate this model, you need to remove the attribute
changed_property in class changed_generated and delete the class
handcrafted_new.

* unchanged_generated                                          :masd_element:

This class has not changed.

** public_attribute                                          :masd_attribute:
   :PROPERTIES:
   :masd.codec.type: int

  :PROPERTIES:
  :masd.codec.stereotypes: cpp_ref_impl::handcrafted::typeable
  :END:

This class is handcrafted. A new attribute was added after initial generation.

** changed_property                                          :masd_attribute:
   :PROPERTIES:
   :masd.codec.type: int
   :END:

This property was added after the initial generation. It should not appear in code
generation. If it does, the overwrite flag for handcrafted is not working.

* changed_generated                                            :masd_element:

This class has a new attribute.

** public_attribute                                          :masd_attribute:
   :PROPERTIES:
   :masd.codec.type: int

   :PROPERTIES:
   :masd.codec.type: int
   :END:

This is a new property and has not yet been generated. Do not check in the
changes.

  :PROPERTIES:
  :masd.codec.stereotypes: cpp_ref_impl::handcrafted::typeable
  :END:

This class is handcrafted.

  :PROPERTIES:
  :masd.codec.stereotypes: cpp_ref_impl::handcrafted::typeable
  :END:

This class is handcrafted but not yet generated. If you see it in git, do not check it in.
